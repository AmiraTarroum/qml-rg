Alex's comments

- GEQS does "only" present a polynomial speedup with respect to classical algorithms. The number of operations to compute gradients does not scale with the number of layers, while in classical algorithms it scales linearly.

- GEQS is additionally optimized using amplitude amplification (see Appendix B)
