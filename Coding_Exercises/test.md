Week 2
================

The topic of the session will be to study autoencoders and their applications and limitations. We will follow part of the keras [tutorial](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html).

**Homework:**
 
This weeks homework consists on three tasks:

1. Construct a simple autoencoder based on the MNIST database or, if you are brave, the CIFAR10 database.
2. Use an autoencoder to denoise images.
3. Build an autoencoder with a compressed representation of dimension 2 (this means 2 neurons in the central layer). Use the enconding part to extract features, plot them and compare the results to the Linear Discriminant Analysis (for an example, see this [link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_lle_digits.html)).
