Notes on Quantum generalisation of feedforward neural networks
==============================================================

This paper gives a twist on gradient descent to train neural networks of the quantum generalization of classical tasks. One of the examples is an autoencoder: a [related and equally interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02806) came out a few days later, which is also worth reading.
