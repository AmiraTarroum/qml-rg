    "1. Introduction\n",
    "================\n",
    "Perhaps instead of telling you how to write a loop or a conditional in Python, it might be a better option to put Python in context, tell a bit about how programming languages are designed, and why certain trade-offs are chosen. A programming language is something you can learn on your own once you understand why it works the way it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compilers, interpreters, JIT compilation\n",
    "===========================================\n",
    "A compiler takes a piece of code written in a high-level language and translates it to binary machine code that the CPU can run. Compilation is a complex process that looks at the entire code, checks syntax, does optimizations, links to other binaries, and spits out an executable or some other form of binary code such as a dynamic library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages parse the code line by line, and thus they only translate something to a machine-executable format one command at a time. This means that you can have an interactive shell and you can type in commands one by one, and see the result immediately. If you make an error, your previous variables and computations are not lost: the interpreter keeps track of them and you can still access them. In contrast, unless you have some mechanism in your compiled code to save interim calculations, an error will terminate the program, and its full memory space is liberated and control is returned to the operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For interactive work, an interpreter is much more suitable. This explains why scientific languages like R, Mathematica, and MATLAB work in this fashion. On the other hand, since there are no optimizations whatsoever, they tend to be sluggish. So for numerical calculations, compiled languages are better: Fortran, C, or newer ones that were designed with safety and concurrency in mind, such as Go and Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "A newer paradigm does just-in-time (JIT) compilation: you get an interactive shell, but everything you enter is actually compiled quickly, and then run. That is, a JIT system combines the best of two worlds. Most modern languages are either written with JIT in mind, such as Scala and Julia, or were adapted to be used in this fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these paradigms, there are abominations like Java: it is both compiled and slow, running on a perfectly horrific level of abstraction called the Java Virtual Machine. MATLAB is a multiparadigm language that is designed to maximize user frustration, although it is primarily interpreted. The following table gives a few examples of each paradigm in approximate temporal order.\n",

    "3. So what is Python?\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "Python is a language *specification* born in 1991. As it is the case with many languages (Fortran, C, C++, Haskell), the language specification and its actual implementations are independently developed, although the development is correlated. What you normally call Python, and this is the Python that ships with your operating system or with Anaconda, is actually the *reference implementation* of the language, which is formally called CPython. This reference implementation is a Python interpreter written in the C language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language was the first language that was **designed with humans in mind**: code was meant to be easy to read by humans. This was a response to write-only languages that introduce tricky syntax that is difficult to decipher. Both Mathematica and MATLAB are guilty of being write-only languages, and so are the latest standards of C++. Here is a priceless Mathematica one-liner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ArrayPlot@Log[BinCounts[Through@{Re,Im}@#&/@NestList[(5#c+Re@#^6-2.7)#+c^5&,.1+.2|,9^7],a={-1,1,0.001},a]+1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You clearly don't syntax highlighting for this. No matter how hard you try, it would be difficult to write something as convoluted as this in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also wants to have exactly **one obvious way to do something**, which was anything but true for a similar scripting language called Perl that many of us refuse to admit that we ever used it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By some clever design decisions, it is extremely easy to call low-level code from Python, and this makes it the best **glue language**: you can call C, Fortran, Julia, Lisp, and whatever functions from Python with ease. Try that from Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default CPython implementation is an interpreter, and therefore it comes with a *shell* (the funny screen where you type stuff in). This shell, however, is not any good by today's standards. IPython was conceived to have a good shell for Python. In principle, IPython can use any Python interpreter on the back (CPython, Pypy, and others). Jupyter provides a notebook interface based on IPython that allows you to practice **literate programming**, that is, mixing code, text, mathematical formula, and images in the same environment, making it attractive for scientists. Mathematica's notebook interface is far more advanced than that of Jupyter, but development is rapid, and the functionality keeps expanding. Both IPython and Jupyter were conceived for Python, but now they work with many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its ease of use and glue language nature, Python became massively popular among programmers. They developed thousands of packages for Python, everything from controlling robots to running websites. It was never designed to be a language for scientific computing. Yet, it became a *de facto* next-best alternative to MATLAB after the unification of the various numerical libraries under the umbrella of numpy and SciPy. With the development of SymPy, it acquired properties similar in functionality to Mathematica. With Pandas, it takes on R as the choice for statistical modelling. With TensorFlow, it is overtaking distributed frameworks like Hadoop and Spark in large-scale machine learning. We can keep listing packages, but you get the idea. The **package ecosystem** gives Python users superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference implementation, CPython, by virtue of being an interpreter, is slow, but it is not the only implementation of the language. Pypy is a JIT implementation of the language, started in 2007. It is up to 20-40x faster on pure Python code. The problem is that its foreign language interface is incompatible with CPython, so the glue language nature is gone, and many important Python packages do not work with it. Cython is an extension of Python that generates C code that in turn can be compiled for speed. As a user of Python, you probably don't want to deal with this directly, but it is nevertheless an option if you want speed. To put this together, we can extend the table above:\n",

    "3.1 Global interpreter lock\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "Python was originally conceived in 1991: until the second half of the 2000s, consumer-grade CPUs were single core. Thus Python was not designed to be easy to parallelize. To understand what goes on here, we have to understand what \"running parallel\" means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually the simplest case is when you have several computers: each one accesses its own memory space and communicates via the network. This is called distributed memory model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next level, we have to understand what a process is. The operating system that you run, let that be Android, macOS, Linux, and even Windows on a good day, ensures that when you run a program, it has its own, protected memory space. It cannot access the memory space allocated to a different program, and other programs cannot access its own allocated memory space. In fact, the operating system itself cannot access the memory space of any of the running programmes: it can terminate them and free the memory, but it cannot access the content of the memory (in principle). A thing that runs with its allocated, protected memory space is called a process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing means running several processes at the same time. If the processes run on several cores on a multicore processor working on the same calculation, you end up with a scheme similar to the distributed memory model: the processes must communicate with one another if they want to exchange data. It does not happen through the network, but the operating system's help must be invoked. This is a shared memory model with isolated memory spaces. Going between multiprocessing and distributed memory processing is straightforward, at least from the users' perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading means that one single process uses several CPU cores. It means that each thread can access an arbitrary piece of data belonging to the process. Now imagine you have some variable *a* and two processes want to increase its value by 1. First, process 1 reads it, learns that the value is 5, and wants to write back 6. The second process reads out 5 as well, and writes back 6. So the final value is 6, instead of 7. This is called a *race condition*. To get around it, the thread can declare a *lock*: no other thread can access that part of the code until the lock is released. If the thread that declared the lock waits for another lock to be released, a *deadlock* can occur: this is an infinite cycle from which there is no exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to have multiprocessing, but multithreading is implicitly forbidden. To avoid race conditions and deadlocks, the interpreter maintains a global lock on every variable: this is called the *global interpreter lock* (GIL). \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is inherently less efficient, so there is an increasing pressure to remove the 26-year-old GIL. Pypy introduced an experimental software transaction memory that replaces the GIL. It is an inefficient implementation and it is more of a proof of concept, but it works. Cython allows you to release the GIL and write multithreaded code in C, if that is your thing. There are also plans that upcoming releases of CPython would slowly outphase the GIL in favour of a software transaction memory, but it will take decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Python 2 versus 3\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "Python 3 is the present and future of the Python language. It is actively developed, whereas Python 2 only receives security updates, and its end-of-life was declared several times (although it refuses to die). Python 3 is a more elegant and consistent language, which is also faster than older versions, at least starting from version 3.5. Yet, there are still some libraries out there that do not work with Python 3. With the release of Python 3.5 in 2015, now most people recommend Python 3. Anaconda changed to recommending Python 3 in January 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition between Python 2 and 3 is a tale of how to do it wrong. Most people never asked for Python 3, and for the first seven years of Python 3, the changes were mainly below the hood. Perhaps the most important change was the proper handling of UTF characters, which sounds abstract for a scientist, until you learn that you can type in Greek characters in mathematical formulas if you use Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the two differences every Python-using scientist should be aware of are related to printing and integer division. If you start your code with this line, you ensure that your code will work in both versions identically:"

    "And on the seventh day, God created [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) is a series of ideas and good practices for writing nice Python code and evolving the language. PEP8 is the set of policies that tells you what makes Python syntax pretty (meaning it is easy to read for any other Python programmer). In an ideal world, everybody should follow it. Start programming in Python by keeping good practices in mind. \n",
